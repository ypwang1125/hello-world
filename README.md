This is my first hello-world project -- for testing GitHub purpose only -- Happy Coding ^--^
========================================================================================================================

Hi everyone!

Yaping here, I like doing data analytics projects and practicing/playing with machine learning algorithms and statistical predictive modeling, and coding in R or Python. I am equipping myself with all hard core of knowledge base and skill sets that a real data scientist should have. 

From today, GitHub becomes my only repository of all my future codes.
