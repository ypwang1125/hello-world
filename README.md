Hi everyone!

Yaping here, I like doing predictive analytics projects and learning machine learning algorithms by implementing them and statistical modeling, and coding in R or Python. I am equipping myself with all hard core of knowledge base and skill sets that a real data scientist should have. 

From today, GitHub becomes my only repository of all my future codes.
